# openKettler
OpenKettler started as a project to get my personal kettler crosstrainer working again, after the main electronics have failed.
Because I wanted everyone to be able to fix simular problems, I decided to make it open source.
The project is still in an alpha phase, which means, that there are lots of features missing and many bugs, due to the active development.
